# Javassist Tutorial

This project will be used for the Javassist tutorial. It contains two modules:
* input
* quickstart

`input` will be used as target in all exercises and `quickstart` is where the
code will be written.
[OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) contains the description of the tasks to be performed.
